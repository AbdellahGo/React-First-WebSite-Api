This is a website I created to publicly display the skills I learned and also to practice what I learned, and it aims to implement and standardize the concepts I learned during the development process. The site features three main components: the home, the recipes, and the dog.

The home page component is the landing page, providing an overview and introduction to the website. It offers a visually appealing and easy-to-use interface.

The recipes component uses an API to retrieve information based on user input. Users can search for recipes, browse through different categories, or explore popular dishes. The component displays dynamically fetched data, providing detailed recipes, ingredients, instructions, and additional information. The user can seamlessly switch back to the Home component or switch to the Dog component using the site router.

In the dog component, another API is integrated to fetch information about dogs. Users can search for specific dog breeds, view details about each breed, and explore images or related characteristics. The component elevates the router to enable smooth transitions between different sections of the site.

Overall, this training site demonstrates the use of React components, API integration, and router functionality to improve user experience and ease navigation. It serves as a hands-on exercise to consolidate the knowledge gained in React development and demonstrates my ability to create interactive and dynamic web applications.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
